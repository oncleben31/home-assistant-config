Welcome to my Home Assistant configuration!

Don't be scared by the non standard structure of the Home Assistant
configuration folder.
I'm inspired by [the strucutre propsed by Franck Nijhof](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).

This system is very modular and very differently structured compared to other
configurations you'll find online.
Basically, each file in the repository does 1 (one, uno, eins) thing only!
Search file with the name of the component, click through it, you'll get it
pretty fast. The `configuration.yaml` is only used to bootstrap the system and
contains some minimal, but vital, settings.

You can watch [a video by Franck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndeybw21PY)
explaining why is doing that way.

I try to add comments and link with external documentations for each YAML file
when needed.
